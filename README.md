# TMDb Movie Data Analysis

## Introduction

This project investigates a dataset of movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. The analysis aims to answer the following questions:

1. Is the film industry making a profit over the years?
2. How long is the average movie?
3. Which genre has the highest number of movies?

## Dataset Description

- The dataset contains information about 10,000 movies.
- Columns like `cast` and `genres` contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
- The final two columns (`budget_adj` and `revenue_adj`) show the budget and revenue adjusted for inflation to 2010 dollars.
